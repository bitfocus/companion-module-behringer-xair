This Module controls the Midas MR series and Behringer XR series of consoles
go over to [Midas](http://www.musictri.be/Categories/Midas/Mixers/Digital/M32/p/P0B3I) or [Behringer](http://www.musictri.be/Categories/Behringer/Mixers/Digital/X32/p/P0ASF)
to get additional information about the consoles and their capabilities.

## Configuration
**Target IP:** Enter the IP address of the Mixer

**Scan for XAir Mixers?** Module will scan for XAir mixers on the network

**Select mixer by Name** Choose a mixer from those located on the network

**Note* Once a mixer (name) is chosen, the module will attempt to re-locate it if the IP changes. This feature can be disabled by un-checking the *Scan for Mixers* option

**Note *mute, solo, processing*:** All mute, solo, and processing actions also have a Toggle option that inverts the current state of the board setting.

**Note *fader adjustment*:** This module stores fader position as a range from 0 (-oo dB) to 100 (+10dB). The conversion from position to dB is explained below. Fader changes also have an optional duration of 0 to 60000 mSec (0 to 60 seconds) to create cross fades. There is an option to limit levels to 0db.

**Note *Storage and Recall*:** Each channel or bus send has one save value. Recall will only restore the last value saved. There are also 10 Global slots available to store a value that may be recalled to any channel. Recalling an empty slot will have no effect.

**Note *Snapshots*:** If the Previous/Next numbered Snapshot is empty, the mixer will not change snapshots. The Save snapshot function does NOT ask for confirmation before saving/overwriting.

**Note *Presets*:** There are some preset buttons included to show some common button configurations with pre-built actions and feedback indicators. They use channel 1 as a demonstration. There is also a 'Rude Solo' button available.

**Note *Snapshot numbers*:** Replace {num} with the desired 2-digit snapshot number: $(xair:s_name_04). A snapshot with no name will have a default name of '#{num}': #04 (it is probably empty).

**Note *Relative Loudness*:** This variable shows the percieved loudness with 0dB fader gain as a reference (100%). +/- 10dB changes become x2/x0.5 respectively as per the Loudness Equation (10 x log2). This allows for a more non-savy user friendly readout. *See table bellow.*

##### Example values :
d (dB) | % (_p)| % (_rp)
-----------------|---------------|---------------
+10 | 100 | 200
0 | 75 | 100
-10 | 50 | 50
-20 | 38 | 25
-30 | 25 | 13
-40 | 19 | 6

## Notes
\* Starred feedbacks are implemented as boolean (on/off) style and can be used in triggers. In order to provide an **off** trigger, these have a **State** option to select which particular state (on/off) to use for the feedback. The default style (button colors) is for the **on** state and may not be applicable to the **off** state.

Channel ranges are maximums (compatible with the X18). If you have an X12 or X16 invalid channels are ignored.

Solo Feedback indicator changes the button color to white on black with an overlay:<br>

## Fader steps to dB information
Similar to the X32, XAir faders implement a 4 linear functions approach with cross points at ‐10, ‐30, ‐60 dB to emulate the log function one can expect to manipulate volume data. Fader controls typically follow a log 10 function to match the human perception of loudness. The volume ratio generic formula: dB value = 20 * log (v2/v1) produces a response curve in blue, as below. On the other hand, XAir faders are using 4 different linear functions with increasing slopes to approximate the dB log transfer shape; the figure below shows the 4 different XAir segments in red (labeled X32).

In both representations, 0db maps to 0.75 and 10dB maps to 1.0

Since the mixer uses 1024 steps per fader, there may be some rounding differences between the mixer display and companion.
